        <h2>Creative Writing: Fiction</h2>
        <p> This class focuses on fiction workshops that cover on short story, covering basic elements of fiction writing and workshopping. I will be able to look at works-in-progress, classes will focus on process, meaning-making, writing for an audience, revision, and productive feedback. By the end of this course I will have two edited short stories, and will need to pick one to make final finishes on. This course will teach me how to get feedback, give feedback, and make changes based on notes or feedback given.  </p>
